## Updates

(October 2023) The above netlify link still works. Essentially this project is an adaptation to my previous [build-it-yourself-bitcoin](https://github.com/ECBSJ/build-it-yourself-bitcoin) app, but this time using React and a new front-end UI design. Since then I've incorporated this concept into a full fledged crypto wallet called [ARTSNL](https://github.com/ECBSJ/ARTSNL).

## Summary

A DIY bitcoin transaction builder built with React.

For a more detailed README, refer to my other repository of a similar app built using ExpressJS [here](https://github.com/ECBSJ/build-it-yourself-bitcoin).
